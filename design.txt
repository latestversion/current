- think about how to make it all into an "engine" or framework. "include Game"
  Provide initial game state, have separate logics, commands etc.
- separate "engine" and adventure specific stuff
- separate core logic and adventure specific logic
- cant save player due to cyclic structure, json pukes
- remove repeatedbroadcast
- remove commented out stuff
- create an information struct to tell game which is starting room (on new game, etc)
- save scheduled events
- think over the logic and command factories
- logic: ownerid, ownid
- aliases for commands, meh!


- remake commandfactory to be more like logicfactory. cf is clunky atm.
- create directory newgamestate automatically if not exist
carrot quest!
- give command (remake command factory first)
- quest logic
- reward..?



- logging framework. severity and groups. l("lla",1,LG_DB), l("muppmupp",4,LG_SAVE).
- calling function traced automatically
- ability to set outstream in loggin framework
- create directory automatically (newgamestate etc) if missing
- validity checkers. things that check valid databases.
- somethign to save the name of the function that got the new operator on it in an object
- possibly specific ctors for the databases
-possibly create the databses in Game
- portals
